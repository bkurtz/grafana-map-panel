# Map Panel

This panel is inspired by the system maps often used for solar panels which visualize the output of each solar panel as a shaded polygon on the map.  I guess in theory you can use it for other data types as well.

## Building

Setup the node environment and install dependencies:

```BASH
yarn install
```

Then build:

```BASH
